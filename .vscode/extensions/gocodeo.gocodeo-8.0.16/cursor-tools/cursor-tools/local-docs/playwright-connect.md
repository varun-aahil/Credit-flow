Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: How can I connect to an already running Chrome window or instance using Playwright?
To connect Playwright to an already running Chrome instance:

1. Launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled:

```
chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

2. Use the `connectOverCDP` method to connect to the running instance:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9222');
  const defaultContext = browser.contexts();
  const page = defaultContext.pages();
  
  // Use the page object to interact with the existing Chrome window
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  
  await browser.close();
})();
```

Key points:

- Chrome must be launched with remote debugging enabled on a specific port
- Use `chromium.connectOverCDP()` to connect to the running instance
- Access the default context and page to interact with the existing window
- This only works for Chromium-based browsers
- You can't create new contexts, only use the existing one

Note that this is not officially supported or recommended by Playwright. It's better to launch and manage browser instances through Playwright when possible[1][6].
